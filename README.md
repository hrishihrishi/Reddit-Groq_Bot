# Reddit-Groq_Bot
reddit posting and commenting automation using Groq ai

Hello everyone in this project I have created a bot where it gets content from Groq AI and posts it directly to Reddit on pre-set schedule.

'generate_content' function asks Groq AI to generate comment based on user input topic.
'generate_comment' function asks Groq AI to generate comment based on "test" subreddit's first post's topic.

You can change these as per yuor convinence:
1.token size
2.sub reddit
3.topic to generate content
4.schedule
5.frequency of posts
6.Groq Ai models
7. content size

please go through the requirments file for all the pre requesites to run the bot. suchas, api keys, secret id etc. And copy paste the entire text without changing variable names in python file.
